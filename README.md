# euler-project
Playground to learn better coding.</br>
Implement problem solutions in different languages (such as Julia, Python, Perl)</br>

Trying to follow these principles:
<ul type="disc">
    <li>Avoid using modules/libraries.</li>
    <li>Don't use other's people code.</li>
    <li>Try to write code, that is easy to read and understand.</li>
    <li>Add comment lines, in order to further clarify code context and algorithms.</li>
</ul>
</br>
